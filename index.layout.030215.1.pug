		//- each of the individual sections will be wrapped as per the full bleed layout except the heroblock
		//- in the original inspiration (http://html5up.net/uploads/demos/dopetrope/index.html) most of the main blocks were sections

		block navbar
			//- here's where the nav menu goes

		block heroblock
			//- typically where the hero image goes

		block highlights
			//- used for special offers, works with the rule of 3

		block portfolio
			//- here's where the numerous portfolio items would go... maybe add the option to select certain types... this time vary the placeholder image sources

		block blog
			//- here's where the latest/most recent blog posts would go

		block footer
			//- there will be multiple sections in here including the copyright section... remember to use the section element
